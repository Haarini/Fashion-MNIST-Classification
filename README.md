# Fashion-MNIST-Classification
A simple deep learning based image classification model built using Fashion MNIST dataset to classify clothes.

In the first model, a simple artificial neural network based model was developed. This gave a training accuracy of 95.22 and testing accuracy of 89.2.

The second model was created using Convolutional Neural Network.
This model gave a training accuracy of 99.55 and testing accuracy of 91.90.

Both these models were trained with 25 epochs in the developed model.
